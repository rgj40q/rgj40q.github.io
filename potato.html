<p>This page is about the conlang 'Prominent Potato' (PP).
<h2>I. Phonology and orthography</h2>
<p>Letters include a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, x, z. Capital letters are not used.
<p>Letters are pronounced as in IPA except: c /ʃ/, j /ʒ/, and h /ɣ/.
<p>Consonants include m, n, r, l, b, d, g, p, t, k, v, z, j, h, f, s, c, x.
<p>Vowels include:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>monophthongs i, u, e, o, a;
<li>rising diphthongs iu, ie, ue, io, uo, ia, ua;
<li>falling diphthongs ui, ei, eu, oi, ou, ai, au.
</ul>
<p>Syllable structure is CV in stem, and CV(C) in part-of-speech suffix.
<p>Borrowed words and personal names that do not fit in these rules must be adapted by either throwing away offending sounds, or by inserting additional sounds to break up clusters. The default choices are 'h' for hiatus and 'e' for consonant clusters.
<p>PP is a syllable-timed language. The weak accent is on the first syllable. There is little to no vowel reduction. Intonation is used for emphasis.
<h2>II. Morphology</h2>
<p>A word belongs to either open or closed class. Open classes are nouns, verbs, appositions, adverbs and gerunds.
<p>An open class word consists of a stem and a part of speech suffix. Other suffixes if any belong to the stem. 
<p>A stem has a <i>valency</i> (how many direct objects a verb of that stem can take including the subject) and in some cases a <i>shift</i> (whether the order of direct objects moved and how much).
<p>The last stem vowel marks the stem valence and its shift:
<table style="text-align:center;width:30%">
<tr><th>valence \ shift<th>0<th>1<th>2<th>3
<tr><th>0<td>-o<td><td><td>
<tr><th>1<td>-a<td><td><td>
<tr><th>2<td>-i<td>-ia<td><td>
<tr><th>3<td>-u<td>-ua<td>-ui<td>
<tr><th>4<td>-e<td>-ie<td>-ei<td>-eu
</table>
<p>Unlike in Lojban, the argument places do not swap, but instead they move to the left in circle. E.g. one step of shift means that the 1st argument becomes the last, 2nd -> 1st, 3rd -> 2nd, and 4th -> 3rd.
<p>A word with the stem of valency 0 may be verb or gerund. A word with the stem of valencies 1-4 may be verb, gerund, noun, apposition, or adverb.
<p>Part-of-speech suffixes:
<table style="width:30%">
<tr><th>part of speech \ level<th>0<th>1<th>2<th>3
<tr><th>gerund<td>-r<td>-ra<td>-ri<td>-ru
<tr><th>noun<td>-n<td>-na<td>-ni<td>-nu
<tr><th>apposition<td>-l<td>-la<td>-li<td>-lu
<tr><th>adverb<td>-m<td>-ma<td>-mi<td>-mu
<tr><th>verb<td>-t<td><td><td>
</table>
<p><i>Level</i> marks the position of a word in a sentence, the further away from the verb, the higher the level. It is discussed in detail in III. Syntax.
<p>Words can freely change from one open class to another. If derived from verb 'someone does it', the meaning of other parts of speech are:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Noun: the one who does it
<li>Apposition: the one who does it
<li>Gerund: the process or action of doing it; to do it
<li>Adverb: in a way or manner someone does it
</ul>
<p>In the dictionary, words are given in verb form, and this is the default. Words belonging to only one class in English are changed as follows: 'apple' -> 'to be an apple', 'beautiful' -> 'to be beautiful', 'very' -> 'to be extreme'.
<p>The difference between a noun and an apposition is that the apposition is a secondary noun describing the main noun. It is similar to an adjective in English and is often translated as an adjective, but not always, e.g. 'He is <i>handy</i> farmer' is translated as an adverb if he is skilled in agriculture, and as an apposition if he is generally a handy person, and at the same time a farmer.

<h2>III. Syntax</h2>
<p>The sentence may consist of a verb phrase with or without arguments, of just one argument, or of an interjection. There must be sentence conjunctions between sentences. The word order is S / V / SV / VS / SOV / SVO / VSO / SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>V / SO<sub>1</sub>VO<sub>2</sub> / SVO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> / VSO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> / SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>V / SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>3</sub> / SO<sub>1</sub>VO<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> / SVO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> / VSO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. i.e. a verb can come before, after, or between its arguments. Top-level adverb phrases can also appear anywhere before, after, or between a verb and arguments. Adverb phrases of levels 1-3 come strictly after the main word (noun, gerund, apposition, or adverb) and its direct arguments, if any. Appositions come after the main noun, its direct arguments, and adverb phrases, if any; there may be many appositions in a row without conjunctions.
<p>Appositions share the level of main noun. Adverbs and arguments are one level below the main word. If a word is of level 3, it may not have dependent words.
<p>All words of valency 2+ and gerunds of valency 1+ may have arguments just like a verb. E.g. 'to be the brother of someone' -> 'a brother of someone', where <i>someone</i> comes without preposition as a direct object of noun.
<p>All arguments are optional. If one is skipped, it is the last, if two, they are the two last etc. To skip the first argument while keeping others, one may use the stem shift.
