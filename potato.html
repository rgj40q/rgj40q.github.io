<p>This page is about the conlang 'Prominent Potato' (PP).</p>
<h2>I. Phonology and orthography</h2>
<p>Letters include a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q,
r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. Capital letters are not used.</p>
<p>Letters are pronounced as in IPA except: q /ŋ/, w /ð/, c /θ/, j /ʒ/, h /ʃ/, and y /ɣ/.
Some variation in the pronunciation of phonemes is allowed as long as the phonemic difference is preserved. E.g.
/r/ may sound as [ɹ]; /x/ may sound as [h]; /ɣ/ may sound as [ʀ] or [ʁ].
<p>Consonants include m, n, r, l, b, d, g, p, t, k, v, z, j, h, f,
s, c, x.</p>
<p>Vowels include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>monophthongs i, u, e, o, a;</li>
<li>rising diphthongs iu, ie, ue, io, uo, ia, ua;</li>
<li>falling diphthongs ui, ei, eu, oi, ou, ai, au.</li>
</ul>
<p>Syllable structure is CV in stem, and CV(C) in part-of-speech
suffix.</p>
<p>Borrowed words and personal names that do not fit in these rules
must be adapted by either throwing away offending sounds, or by
inserting additional sounds to break up clusters. The default
choices are 'h' for hiatus and 'e' for consonant clusters.</p>
<p>PP is a syllable-timed language. The weak accent is on the first
syllable. There is little to no vowel reduction. Intonation is used
for emphasis.</p>
<h2>II. Morphology</h2>
<p>A word belongs to either open or closed class. Open classes are
nouns, verbs, appositions, adverbs and gerunds.</p>
<p>An open class word consists of a stem and a part of speech
suffix. Other suffixes if any belong to the stem.</p>
<p>A stem has a <i>valency</i> -- how many direct objects a verb of
that stem can take including the subject.</p>
<p>The last stem vowel marks the stem valence:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>valence</th>
<th>last vowel</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>-o</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>-a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>-i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>-u</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>-e</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In order to switch argument places one may use the prefixes na-,
ni-, and nu-. They shift arguments to the left 1, 2, and 3 times
respectifully in circle. E.g. one step of shift for valency of 4 means
that the 1st argument becomes the last, 2nd -&gt; 1st, 3rd -&gt; 2nd,
and 4th -&gt; 3rd.</p>
<p>A word with the stem of valency of 0 may be verb or gerund. A word
with the stem of valencies of 1-4 may be verb, gerund, noun,
apposition, or adverb.</p>
<p>Part-of-speech suffixes:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>part of speech \ level</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>gerund</th>
<td>-r</td>
<td>-ra</td>
<td>-ri</td>
<td>-ru</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>noun</th>
<td>-n</td>
<td>-na</td>
<td>-ni</td>
<td>-nu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>apposition</th>
<td>-l</td>
<td>-la</td>
<td>-li</td>
<td>-lu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>adverb</th>
<td>-m</td>
<td>-ma</td>
<td>-mi</td>
<td>-mu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>verb</th>
<td>-t</td>

</tr>

<p><i>Level</i> marks the position of a word in a sentence, the
further away from the verb, the higher the level. It is discussed
in detail in III. Syntax.</p>
<p>Words can freely change from one open class to another. If
derived from verb 'someone does it', the meaning of other parts of
speech are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Noun: the one who does it</li>
<li>Apposition: the one who does it</li>
<li>Gerund: the process or action of doing it; to do it</li>
<li>Adverb: in a way or manner someone does it</li>
</ul>
<p>In the dictionary, words are given in verb form, and this is the
default. Words belonging to only one class in English are changed
as follows: 'apple' -&gt; 'to be an apple', 'beautiful' -&gt; 'to
be beautiful', 'very' -&gt; 'to be extreme', 'in'-&gt; 'to be in'.</p>
<p>The difference between a noun and an apposition is that the
apposition is a secondary noun describing the same thing as a main
noun. It is
similar to an adjective in English and is often translated as an
adjective, but not always, e.g. 'He is <i>handy</i> farmer' is
translated as an adverb if he is skilled in farming, and as an
apposition if he is generally a handy person, and at the same time
a farmer.</p>
<p>Numerals are positional, i.e. you pronounce each digit and symbol
in one word. For convenience there are words for 3, 6, 9 zeros and
so on. The syllable 'ca' in the end of a stem is reserved for numerals.
So if a stem ends in 'ca' it must be interpreted as numeral.</p>
<p>Digits are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>syllable</th>
<th>meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>za</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ni</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tu</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ra</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ki</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pu</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sa</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vi</td>
<td>7</td>

<tr>
<td>xu</td>
<td>8</td>

<tr>
<td>la</td>
<td>9</td>

<tr>
<td>nia</td>
<td>000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tua</td>
<td>000 000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rai</td>
<td>000 000 000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>kia</td>
<td>0x12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pua</td>
<td>0x15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sai</td>
<td>0x18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>via</td>
<td>0x21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>xua</td>
<td>0x24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lai</td>
<td>0x27</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>di</td>
<td>divided by (for simple fractions)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gu</td>
<td>decimal comma or point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>na</td>
<td>unary minus</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A numeral stem ends in one of the following suffixes:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>suffix</th>
<th>meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ca</td>
<td>nominal number, e.g. number one, number two</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>duca</td>
<td>cardinal number, e.g. one apple, one time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bica</td>
<td>ordinal number, e.g. first, second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gaca</td>
<td>multiplier, e.g. single / one by one, double / in pairs</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So the numeral stem has valency of 1. E.g. nitucan - a number 12,
saraducat - is in quantity of 63, ninibical - 11th.</p>
<h2>III. Syntax</h2>
<p>The sentence may consist of a verb phrase with or without
arguments, of just one argument, or of an interjection. There must
be sentence conjunctions between sentences. The word order is S / V
/ SV / VS / SOV / SVO / VSO / SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>V /
SO<sub>1</sub>VO<sub>2</sub> / SVO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> /
VSO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> /
SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>V /
SO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>3</sub> /
SO<sub>1</sub>VO<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> /
SVO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> /
VSO<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. i.e. a verb can come
before, after, or between its arguments, while maintaining the order
of the arguments. Top-level adverb phrases
can also appear anywhere before, after, or between a verb and
arguments. Adverb phrases of levels 1-3 come strictly after the
main word (noun, gerund, apposition, or adverb) and its direct
arguments, if any. Appositions come after the main noun, its direct
arguments, and adverb phrases, if any; there may be many
appositions in a row. Conjunctions are not used with appositions.</p>
<p>Appositions share the level of main noun. Adverbs and arguments
are one level below the main word. If a word is of level 3, it may
not have dependent words.</p>
<p>All words of valency 2+ and gerunds of valency 1+ may have
arguments just like a verb. E.g. 'to be the brother of me' -&gt; 'a
brother of me', where <i>me</i> comes without preposition as a
direct object of noun.</p>
<p>All arguments are optional. If one is skipped, it is the last,
if two, they are the two last etc. To skip the first argument while
keeping others, one may use the stem shift.</p>
<p>Adverbs have comparative and superlative forms. Comparative
phrase: mo ADV ce SENT le - more X than Z [subsentence terminator].
Superlative phrase: nai ADV - the most X.</p>
<p>Sentences, argument phrases, and adverb phrases of different
levels use different conjunctions to enumerate things. They
are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>type \ meaning</th>
<th>'and'</th>
<th>'or'</th>
<th>'but'</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>sentence</th>
<td>ta</td>
<td>ti</td>
<td>tu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>adverb level=0</th>
<td>ma</td>
<td>mi</td>
<td>mu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>adverb level=1</th>
<td>meu</td>
<td>mia</td>
<td>mua</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>adverb level=2</th>
<td>mai</td>
<td>mie</td>
<td>mui</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>adverb level=3</th>
<td>mau</td>
<td>miu</td>
<td>muo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>argument level=0</th>
<td>ra</td>
<td>ri</td>
<td>ru</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>argument level=1</th>
<td>reu</td>
<td>ria</td>
<td>rua</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>argument level=2</th>
<td>rai</td>
<td>rie</td>
<td>rui</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>argument level=3</th>
<td>rau</td>
<td>riu</td>
<td>ruo</td>
</tr>
